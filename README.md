# NEARspring-nftchallenge

This challenge is the sixth challenge in NEAR spring.

The war in Ukraine has affected each Ukrainian and a lot of people around the globe. At the moment the war is being actively waged and is in the hot phase, but when Ukraine wins, a new stage will begin - the stage of restoration of our country.
Ukrainian zoos are in severe need of help now and will be in need after the war ends. There are no visitors in the zoos, which results in no budgeting.
You need to create an NFT project which will aid in attracting funds that will be allocated to buy food for animals or help zoos restore their work after the war is over.


## The solution:
Build a dApp to gether donations for the animals. Whenever a user mint the nft related to the animal he will make donation with 3 NEAR to that animal  

* The app is delpoyed on github pages . See it [here](https://rashaabdulrazzak.github.io/nearspring-ch6-nftzoo/)
* The video explain the app on loom. Watch it[here](https://www.loom.com/share/8c7b12e8bbfd473da14d5129d9a8cd73)
* The contract is deployed to the account name `zoohelp.testnet` 
* The contract code is taken from the [NFT Zero to Hero](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/contracts/nfts/introduction#:~:text=In%20this%20Zero%20to%20Hero,contract%20that%20supports%20every%20extension). and it is located on [this repo](https://github.com/rashaabdulrazzak/nearspring-ch6-contract)
* The frontend built over the prevuios chalenge(mint nft challeng) as they are related

- Run `npm start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
